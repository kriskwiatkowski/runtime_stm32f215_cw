# Runtime for stm32f2 platform

Creates runtime environment that allows running apps on STM32F2. One needs to build the solution, link resulting static library with the application and push to the board. Solution contains implementation of `printf` that sends data over UART to the terminal.

## Building

```
cmake --preset stm32f2
cmake --build --preset stm32f2
cpack --preset stm32f2
```

Libraries will be compiled and placed in the ``build/pack`` directory.

## Test program

To run test program:
```
st-flash --reset write out/stm32f2/pack/bin/hello.bin 0x8000000
```

## Flash to ChipWhisprer

Enable uart output

```
python tools/cw_uart_init.py
```

Flash the binary

```
pyocd flash /home/kris/repos/ams/runtime_stm32f215/out/stm32f2/bin/hello.bin -t STM32F215RETx
```
